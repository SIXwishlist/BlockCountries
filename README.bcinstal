bcinstall is an installation aid for BlockCountries.


This script will determine if perl is installed on your system 
and will determine  whether all the required library modules are installed.

Simply download the script, make it executable, and run it. 
(No parameters are required.)

If it says -YÂ´All needed perl modules are installedÂ¡, block countries
should run (assuming that iptables is installed.)

If it says that you need to install perl, it should be packaged for your 
distribution (apt-get, yum, etc.) If you canâ€™t find a current perl version
for your distribution (which would be very, very surprising)  you can find
it at http://www.perl.org.

If it says that you need to install a perl module, here is how to do this:

Some distributions provide many of the modules under yum, apt-get, etc. 

If yours doesnâ€™t  or doesnâ€™t have one that this needs, use cpan. 
There should be a cpan command installed with Perl. Just say cpan to the 
shell, then install modulename (like IO::Uncompress::Gunzip) and it should
just work. â€˜quitâ€™ exits cpan.

Install the module, then run bcinstall again. Repeat until bcinstall reports
that you have all the needed modules.
