bcinstall is an installation aid for BlockCountries.


This script will determine if perl is installed on your system 
and will determine  whether all the required library modules are installed.

Simply download the script, make it executable, and run it. 
(No parameters are required.)

If it says 'All needed perl modules are installed', block countries
should run (assuming that iptables is installed.)

If it says that you need to install perl, it should be packaged for your 
distribution (apt-get, yum, etc.) If you canâ€™t find a current perl version
for your distribution (which would be very, very surprising)  you can find
it at http://www.perl.org.

If it says that you need to install a perl module, here is how to do this:

Some distributions provide many of the modules under yum, apt-get, etc. 

If yours doesn't provide modules or doesn't have one that this needs, use
cpan. 
  There should be a cpan command installed with Perl. Just say cpan to the 
  shell, then install modulename (like IO::Uncompress::Gunzip) and it should
  just work. 'quit' exits cpan.

Install the module, then run bcinstall again. Repeat until bcinstall reports
that you have all the needed modules.  Usually, this is all that is
necessary.

Note that some of these modules are shipped with the Perl core distribution.
The others are on CPAN, though it's better to use the ones packaged by your
distribution, as multiple update managers can confuse each-other.

The library modules may depend on certain versions of Perl.  This is handled
by the distribution update managers.  With CPAN, if you are running an older
version of Perl, the latest version of a module may fail to install.  In
this case, you can either have CPAN install an older compatible version of
the module, or update Perl.

Versions of Perl and library modules:
=====================================

bcinstall does NOT check the version of Perl installed on your system.

  BlockCountries is known to run on Perl as early as 5.8.8, and as recent
  as 5.12.4.  It should run on more recent releases; file bugs at
  http://github.com/tlhackque/BlockCountries/issues if not.

bcinstall does NOT check for the minimum required version of the library
modules.  See the BlockCountries README.md for versions known to work.

  Earlier versions may or may not work; use them at your own risk.  Later
  versions should work (as long as they are compatible with your version
  of Perl).

As newer versions often fix bugs, updating is encouraged.
If you determine that a newer version of a library module is required by
or breaks BlockCountries, please file a bug report.

Caveat:
======

If Perl is used by other software on your system, that software may
depend on specific versions of Perl or Perl library modules.  Although
BlockCountries should not impose incompatible dependencies, managing
these is beyon the scope of this document.
