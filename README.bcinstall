bcinstall is an installation aid for BlockCountries.

To run:
   bcinstall

This script will determine if perl is installed on your system
and will determine  whether all the required library modules are installed.

Simply download the script, make it executable, and run it.
(No parameters are required.)

If it says 'All checks completed successfully', BlockCountries
should run.

To see the installed versions of the modules that it checks for, use
   bcinstall -v

If it says that you need to install perl, it should be packaged for your
distribution (apt-get, yum, etc.) If you canâ€™t find a current perl version
for your distribution (which would be very, very surprising)  you can find
it at http://www.perl.org.

If it says that you need to install a perl module, here is how to do this:

Most distributions provide all of the modules as packages, using yum, apt-get, etc.

If yours doesn't provide modules or doesn't have one that this needs, use
cpan.  bcinstall will provide guidance.

Install the module(s), then run bcinstall again. Repeat until bcinstall reports
that you have all the needed modules.  Usually, this is all that is
necessary.

Note that some of these modules are shipped with the Perl core distribution.
The others are on CPAN, though it's better to use the ones packaged by your
distribution, as multiple update managers can confuse each-other.

The library modules may depend on certain versions of Perl.  This is handled
by the distribution update managers.  With CPAN, if you are running an older
version of Perl, the latest version of a module may fail to install.  In
this case, you can either have CPAN install an older compatible version of
the module, or update Perl.

Versions of Perl and library modules:
=====================================

bcinstall checks the version of Perl installed on your system.

BlockCountries is known to run on Perl as early as 5.8.8, and as recent
as 5.12.4.  It should run on more recent releases; file bugs at
http://github.com/tlhackque/BlockCountries/issues if not.


bcinstall also checks the version of each library module.  The
minimums are fairly conservative.  However, in many cases earlier
versions have bugs that break BlockCountries.

As newer versions often fix bugs, updating is encouraged.
If you determine that a newer version of a library module is required by
or breaks BlockCountries, please file a bug report.

Caveat:
======

If Perl is used by other software on your system, that software may
depend on specific versions of Perl or Perl library modules.  Although
BlockCountries should not impose incompatible dependencies, managing
these is beyond the scope of this document.
